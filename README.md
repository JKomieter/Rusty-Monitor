# Rusty_Monitor

## Concept:

Rusty Monitor is a lightweight system monitoring and alerting tool written in Rust. It allows users to remotely monitor various aspects of their systems (servers, desktops, etc.) and receive alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomalies.

## Features:

- System Metrics Collection: The tool should be able to collect various system metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, network traffic, and process information. You can leverage existing libraries like psutil or cgroups for this purpose.
  Customizable Monitoring: Allow users to define specific metrics to monitor and configure thresholds for triggering alerts.
- Alerting System: Implement an alerting system that can notify users through email, SMS, or push notifications when a monitored metric exceeds a threshold or falls outside a healthy range.
- Data Visualization: Provide basic data visualization tools to display collected metrics over time, allowing users to identify trends and potential issues.
  Agent-based Architecture: Consider an agent-based architecture where a lightweight Rust agent runs on each system being monitored and communicates with a central server for data aggregation and alerting.

## Deadlines and Milestones:

- Week 1: Design the system architecture and define the core components of the monitoring tool.
- Week 2: Implement the data collection module to gather system metrics from various sources.
- Week 3: Develop the alerting system to notify users of any anomalies or threshold breaches.
- Week 4: Develop a user interface (web based) for configuring monitoring settings, viewing metrics, and managing alerts.
- Week 5: Implement data visualization tools to display collected metrics in a meaningful way.
- Week 6: Test the system for performance, scalability, and reliability. Address any issues or bugs found during testing.
- Week 7: Prepare documentation and user guides for deploying and using the monitoring tool.
- Week 8: Finalize the project and present a demo to the team and stakeholders.

## Technologies:

- Rust: The core programming language for building the monitoring tool.
- Actix: A powerful, actor-based web framework for building the user interface and API endpoints.
- Prometheus: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that can be used for collecting and storing metrics.
- Grafana: A popular data visualization tool that can be integrated with Prometheus to create dashboards and graphs.
- Docker: Containerization technology to package and deploy the monitoring tool in a consistent and reproducible manner.
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for managing and scaling the monitoring tool across multiple nodes.
- Redis: In-memory data store for caching and storing temporary data used by the monitoring tool.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing configuration settings, user data, and other persistent information.
- React: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces for the web-based monitoring dashboard.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that can be used to write more robust and maintainable frontend code.
